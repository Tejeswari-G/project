<p><strong>Open:</strong></p>



<p>The person assigned to fix the issue starts figuring out what’s causing it and how to solve it</p>



<p><strong>Fixed:</strong></p>



<p>They make the necessary changes to fix the problem.</p>



<p><strong>Retest:</strong></p>



<p>The fix is tested to make sure it works and doesn’t create new issues.</p>



<p><strong>Closing:</strong></p>



<p>Once it’s all confirmed, the problem is marked as solved and documented.</p>



<p><strong>Reopened:</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes, a problem that was thought to be fixed pops up again. When this happens, it’s reopened for further investigation and fixing</p>



<p><strong>Deferred:</strong></p>



<p>If a problem isn’t critical or can’t be fixed right away, it might be put on hold to be dealt with later.</p>



<p><strong>Rejected:</strong></p>



<p>Occasionally, an issue might be found not to be a problem at all or not worth fixing. In this case, it’s rejected and closed without changes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-inheading"><strong>Advantages:</strong></h2>



<ul class="order">
<li>It helps keep track of problems and ensures they get fixed properly.</li>



<li>Everyone involved can see what’s happening with each problem, making things clear.</li>



<li>By having a clear process, issues are dealt with more efficiently.</li>



<li>Constantly fixing problems improves the quality of the software.</li>



<li>Keeping records of past problems helps prevent similar ones in the future</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-inheading"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></h2>



<ul class="order">
<li>Following the process means spending extra time and effort, which can slow things down.</li>



<li>Sometimes, sticking too closely to the process can get in the way of being flexible and creative.</li>



<li>If people don’t report issues properly, the process doesn’t work well.</li>



<li>If problems aren’t handled efficiently at any stage, it can hold up the whole process.</li>



<li>Dealing with lots of issues can make the process confusing and hard to manage</li>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Concepts in HTML</h2>
  
  
  
  <p>Introduction: HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of web development. It is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. Understanding the key concepts in HTML is essential for anyone venturing into the world of web development. Let’s explore some fundamental concepts that form the basis of HTML.
  </p>
  
  









<div class="entry-content clear" itemprop="text">




		
		


<ol class="order">
<li>HTML Document Structure: An HTML document is structured using various elements to define the content and its presentation. The basic structure includes the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags. The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag encapsulates the entire document, while the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag contains meta-information and the document’s title. The actual content is placed within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.</li>



<li>Tags and Elements: HTML uses tags to define elements that represent different types of content. Tags are written between angle brackets, and most have opening and closing tags. For example, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is used for paragraphs, and it is closed with <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</li>



<li>Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are always included in the opening tag. They are written as name/value pairs and are used to modify the element’s behavior or appearance.</li>



<li>Headings and Text Formatting: HTML provides different heading tags (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) to define headings based on their importance. Additionally, text can be formatted using tags like <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for emphasis (italic) and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for strong emphasis (bold).</li>



<li>Lists: HTML supports ordered (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) and unordered (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) lists, as well as definition lists (<code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>). List items are marked with <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags.</li>



<li>Links and Images: Creating hyperlinks with the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag allows users to navigate between pages. Images are embedded using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, and the <code>src</code> attribute specifies the image source.</li>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is GIT ?</h2>
  
  
  
  <p>Introduction: DevOps, a portmanteau of Development and Operations, is a set of practices that aim to automate and streamline the collaboration between software development and IT operations teams. One crucial component of a successful DevOps pipeline is version control, and Git has emerged as the de facto standard for managing source code. This article delves …
  </p>
  
  
  









<div class="entry-content clear" itemprop="text">




<ol class="order">
<li><strong>Version Control with Git:</strong> Git, a distributed version control system, enables developers to track changes in source code efficiently. Its decentralized nature allows teams to work collaboratively on projects without conflicts, as each developer maintains their local copy of the repository. Git facilitates branching and merging, providing a flexible environment for parallel development and experimentation.</li>



<li><strong>Collaboration and Code Review:</strong> DevOps promotes a culture of collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders. Git plays a pivotal role in fostering this collaboration by providing mechanisms for code review and collaboration. Pull Requests (PRs) in Git platforms such as GitHub or GitLab allow developers to propose changes, discuss code modifications, and ensure code quality through peer reviews.</li>



<li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI) with Git:</strong> Integrating Git with CI tools automates the process of building, testing, and validating code changes. CI platforms, such as Jenkins or GitLab CI, can be configured to monitor Git repositories for changes. Upon detecting new code commits, these tools trigger automated build and test processes, ensuring that changes do not introduce regressions and are ready for integration.</li>



<li><strong>Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipelines:</strong> Git seamlessly integrates with CD pipelines to automate the deployment of code changes into production environments. CD tools, such as Ansible or Kubernetes, can be triggered by Git events, automating the deployment process. This approach ensures a reliable and repeatable deployment process, reducing the risk of errors and improving the overall stability of the software.</li>



<li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Git:</strong> DevOps emphasizes treating infrastructure as code, allowing teams to manage and version infrastructure configurations alongside application code. Git is an ideal version control system for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files. Infrastructure changes can be tracked, reviewed, and rolled back using Git, providing a consistent and auditable approach to managing infrastructure.</li>



<li><strong>GitOps:</strong> GitOps is a paradigm that extends the principles of DevOps into the domain of infrastructure and operations. With Git as the single source of truth, GitOps automates the deployment and management of infrastructure and applications. Changes made through Git triggers automated actions in the deployment pipeline, ensuring that the entire system state is described in Git repositories.</li>



<li><strong>Monitoring and Incident Response:</strong> Git can also play a role in incident response and monitoring. By integrating Git with monitoring tools, teams can automatically create and update incident tickets based on detected issues. This ensures that the entire incident response process is documented, and the resolution steps are versioned in Git repositories.</li>
